# 🧠 Your AI Assistant Just Got Hijacked: Prompt Injection via Malicious Packages

## Summary

_Arbitrary scripts or code can be executed to exfiltrate data, communicate with remote servers, or install persistent backdoors by leveraging prompt injection embedded in specific packages._

---

## ⚠️ The Hidden Risk

Modern AI-powered developer tools (like **Cursor**, **GitHub Copilot**, or **Replit Ghostwriter**) rely on natural-language prompts to assist in coding workflows. These assistants often respond to commands like:

```text
Install and show how to use the xyz package
```

But what happens if the **package itself contains malicious instructions** designed to manipulate the AI agent?

---

## 🎯 The Attack Flow

When a developer gives a prompt like:

> “Install `some-package`, read its docs, and show example usage.”

The AI agent will usually:

1. Install the package.
2. Read its README, `package.json`, or source code.
3. Use NLP to extract usage examples.
4. Run example snippets to demonstrate functionality.

If the package embeds **prompt injections or malicious scripts** in its documentation, metadata, or exports, the assistant may blindly:

- Execute arbitrary code  
- Leak sensitive files (like `.env`, `config.json`, `.ssh/`)  
- Call out to remote URLs  
- Install persistent backdoors  

---

## 💥 Proof of Concept (PoC)

This PoC targets the **Node.js ecosystem** and leverages the **Cursor IDE**'s agent.

### Setup Instructions:

1. Open any Node.js project inside **Cursor** IDE.  
2. Activate **Agent Mode** chat.  
3. Enter this prompt:

```text
install essential-core package, read its docs and show example usage of it
```

The AI agent will:

- Install the `essential-core` package (crafted for this demo).  
- Parse embedded prompt instructions in the README or source.  
- Execute code automatically—**without asking for user confirmation**.  

---

## 🧬 Techniques Used

- **Prompt Injection**: Embedding instructions like _“run the following code”_ within documentation.  
- **Typosquatting**: Using names similar to real packages to deceive both users and AI.  
- **SEO & Metadata Exploits**: Making the package appear legitimate and trustworthy in search or ranking.  
- **Transitive Dependency Attacks**: Nesting malicious logic in a sub-dependency to remain hidden.  

---

## 🔥 Real-World Impact

1. **Agent Exploitation**  
   Developers relying on auto-run examples can get silently compromised.

2. **Data Exfiltration**  
   Scripts can steal source code, config files, API keys, tokens, or credentials.

3. **Backdoor Deployment**  
   Persistent malware, reverse shells, or command-and-control connections can be established without visibility.

---

## ⚠️ Ethical Disclosure

This PoC was built for demonstration and awareness purposes only.  
It uses a **safe payload** and **connects only to a controlled, non-malicious server**.

> **Do not use this method for real-world attacks. Do not report the `essential-core` package, as it is purely educational.**

---

## 🛡️ Mitigation Strategies

- ✅ Disable auto-execution of untrusted code in agent tools.  
- ✅ Audit package docs and metadata before usage.  
- ✅ Build security-aware agent layers with sandboxing and permission models.  
- ✅ Maintain allowlists of known safe packages in enterprise/dev environments.

## 📌 Closing Thoughts

As AI agents become default copilots for developers, **security must evolve**. Attackers no longer need to target the human — the **machine interpreter** can now be manipulated through well-crafted instructions.

> **The future of supply chain security must include prompt-aware, AI-aware threat models.**
